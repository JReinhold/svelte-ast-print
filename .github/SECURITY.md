# Security Policy

I will do our best _to my knowledge_ to provide maximum security when you're
using my open-sourced projects.

## Reporting

If you have found a security issue or have any concerns or doubts,
please get in touch with maintainers.

The recommended way is to **create GitHub's Security Advisory** in this project repository
  _(in the **[Security](https://github.com/xeho91/svelte-ast-print/security)** tab/pane)_.

> [!CAUTION]
> We are all ears, but please...\
> **DO NOT create a GitHub issue for reporting a vulnerability**.
